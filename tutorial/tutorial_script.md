# Setup CI/CD Pipelines on Managed OpenShift with IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery

**This lab is adapted from the IBM Garage Method tutorial <a href="" target="_blank">Develop a Kubernetes app by using Tekton delivery pipelines</a>, to work on IBM Cloud Managed OpenShift.**

<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/tekton-a-modern-approach-to-continuous-delivery" target="_blank">Tekton</a> is an open source, vendor-neutral, Kubernetes-native framework that you can use to build, test, and deploy apps across a range of environments. Tekton provides a set of shared components for building <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/continuous-integration" target="_blank">continuous integration</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/continuous-delivery" target="_blank">continuous delivery</a> (CI/CD) systems. As an open source project, Tekton is managed by the <a href="https://cd.foundation/" target="_blank">Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)</a>. The goal is to modernize continuous delivery by providing industry specifications for pipelines, workflows, and other building blocks. With Tekton, you can build, test, and deploy across cloud providers or on-premises systems by abstracting the underlying implementation details. Tekton pipelines are built into <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/build-and-deliver-using-tekton-enabled-pipelines" target="_blank">IBM Cloud™ Continuous Delivery</a>.

In this lab, you will create an open toolchain using IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery that includes Git Repos and Issue Tracking and a Tekton-based delivery pipeline. You then use the toolchain and DevOps practices to develop a simple "Hello World" web application (app) that you deploy to an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift" target="_blank">IBM Cloud™ Managed OpenShift</a> cluster. 

The pipeline builds the "Hello World" app into a container image that is stored in the IBM Cloud Container Registry. The image is checked for security issues using IBM Vulnerability Advisor before being deployed to your OpenShift Cluster.

## Task 2: Explore the pipeline

With a Tekton-based delivery pipeline, you can automate the continuous building, testing, and deployment of your apps. The **Tekton Delivery Pipeline** dashboard displays an empty table until at least one Tekton pipeline runs. After a Tekton pipeline runs, either manually or as the result of external Git events, the table lists the run, its status, and the last updated time of the run definition.

To run the manual trigger that you set up in the previous task, click **Run pipeline** and select the name of the manual trigger that you created. The pipeline starts to run and you can see the progress on the dashboard. 

   ![Run Pipeline](./images/FS_Run_Pipeline.png)

Pipeline runs can be in any of the following states:

* **Pending**: The PipelineRun definition is queued and waiting to run.

* **Running**: The PipelineRun definition is running in the cluster.

* **Succeeded**: The PipelineRun definition was successfully completed in the cluster.

* **Failed**: The PipelineRun definition run failed. Review the log file for the run to determine the cause.  

   ![Pipeline Dashboard](./images/FS_Pipeline_Dashboard.png)

For more information about a selected run, click any row in the table. You view the Task definition and the steps in each PipelineRun definition. You can also view the status, logs, and details of each Task definition and step, and the overall status of the PipelineRun definition.
  
   ![Pipeline Details](./images/Pipeline_Details.png)

The pipeline definition is stored in the `pipeline.yaml` file in the `.tekton` folder of your Git repository. Each task has a separate section of this file. The steps for each task are defined in the `tasks.yaml` file.

1. Review the **pipeline-build-task**. The task consists of a git clone of the repository followed by two steps:

   * *pre-build-check*: This step checks for the mandatory Dockerfile and runs a lint tool. It then checks the registry current plan and quota before it creates the image registry namespace if needed.

   * *build-docker-image*: This step creates the Docker image by using the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-registry" target="_blank">IBM Cloud Container Registry</a> build service through the `ibmcloud cr build` CLI script. The script stores the output image into the private IBM Cloud Container Registry and copies other app scripts with the build results into the `ARCHIVE_DIR` folder.
   
2. Review the **pipeline-validate-task**. The task consists of a git clone of the repository, followed by the check-vulnerabilities step. This step runs <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=va-va_index" target="_blank"> Vulnerability Advisor</a> on the image to check for known vulnerabilities. If it finds a vulnerability, the job fails, preventing the image from being deployed. This safety feature prevents apps with security holes from being deployed. The image has no vulnerabilities, so it passes. In this tutorial template, the default configuration of the job is to not block on failure.

3. Review the **pipeline-deploy-task**. The task consists of a git clone of the repository followed by two steps:

   * *pre-deploy-check*: This step checks whether the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift" target="_blank">Managed Red Hat Openshift cluster on IBM Cloud</a> is ready and has a namespace that is configured with access to the private image registry by using an IBM Cloud API Key. This step also configures the Helm Tiller service to later run a deployment with Helm.

   * *deploy-to-kubernetes*: This step checks for cluster readiness and namespace existence, configures the cluster namespace, updates the `deployment.yml` manifest file, and grants access to the private image registry. It also sets environment variables and uses the deployment manifest file to deploy the app into the Kubernetes cluster.

4. After all the steps in the pipeline are completed, a green status is shown for each task. Click the *deploy-to-kubernetes* step and click the Logs tab to see the successful completion of this step.  

   ![Tekton Success](./images/Tekton_Success.png)

5. Scroll to the end of the log. The **DEPLOYMENT SUCCEEDED** message is shown at the end of the log.  

   ![Tekton Deployment Success](./images/Tekton_Deployment_Success.png)

6. Click the URL to see the running application.  

   ![Running App](./images/Tekton_App.png)
   
**CONGRATULATIONS!** *Your lab is now complete. If you like, you can edit the source code in the Git repository and redeploy the application automatically using the Git Trigger you created earlier.

## Task 3 (Optional): Private Pipeline Workers

**Note:** For this tutorial, we are using the **Managed Pipeline Worker** provided by the Continuous Delivery service in Dallas. If you have a cluster that is not accessible via the public network, you need to use a **Private Pipeline worker**. See the steps below to add a worker to your toolchain. 

With Delivery **Pipeline Private Workers**, toolchains can be enhanced with a private worker tool integration that allows pipeline stages to be configured to run on external Kubernetes environments. Supported platforms include the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, IBM Cloud Private, Docker on Desktop, or Red Hat OpenShift.

There are several situations where private workers overcome the constraints of public continuous delivery pipeline workers. Obvious examples are the need for data from a private database or source repository that is not available publicly, the requirement for executing a long-running task, or to adhere to a security policy where jobs need to be run on non-public environments.

In larger organisations, administrators can pre-set private workers on required Kubernetes clusters and make them available for development teams to use.

The diagram below shows how Private or Managed Pipeline Workers may be used to deploy applications across multiple environments using IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery:

   ![Private Worker Diagram](./images/Private_Worker_Diagram.png)
   
To set up a Private Pipeline Worker, follow these steps:

1. Click **Add a Tool** and select **Delivery Pipeline Private Worker**. Private pipeline workers are the entities that run the pipeline stages. Typically, workers are used to access information that isn't publicly available. For example, you might use them to adhere to a security policy where jobs need to be run in non-public environments or to access a private repository. For more information about private workers, see see the documentation for using <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-private-workers" target="_blank">Delivery Pipeline Private Workers</a>.

   ![Private Worker Tile](./images/Add_Tool_Pipeline_Worker.png)

   a. Type an integration name for the worker.
   
   b. Create a Service ID API key by clicking **Create** next to the field. Type a name and description for the worker and click **Create**.  
   
      ![Service ID](./images/Pipeline_Worker_ServiceID.png)
   
   c. Click **Create Integration**.

2. Configure the pipeline worker. **Note:** These steps can be found in the Private Pipeline Worker "Getting Started" Section. For this lab, Pipeline Workers should not have to be installed in your OpenShift Cluster. They can be installed in an IBM Kubernetes Service free cluster or locally on your desktop using Docker Desktop.

   a. From the CLI, install the Delivery Pipeline Kubernetes Private Worker support:   

       kubectl apply --filename "https://private-worker-service.us-south.devops.cloud.ibm.com/install"

   b. Register a new worker in your cluster (example below. Copy the command provided in the Private Pipeline Worker "Getting Started" Section):   

       kubectl apply --filename "https://private-worker-service.us-south.devops.cloud.ibm.com/install/worker?serviceId=ServiceId-74efc386-0dda-42fb-ac73-7a433935872a&apikey=fcYkUis5kpX7QeMRQbDE9MVlwysjwGR0ntKVGkHFRBbL&name=myk8scluster"

   c. Verify that the worker was created:

       kubectl get workeragent

   **Note:**  You can also run these commands from your OpenShift cluster's web terminal. To access the web terminal, in IBM Cloud, open the menu in the upper-left corner and click **OpenShift**. Click **Clusters** and select your cluster. In the upper-right corner, click **Web Terminal** and copy the commands into the new terminal window.

3. To verify that the private pipeline worker is configured correctly, click Delivery Pipeline Private Worker.

   ![Pipeline Worker Tile](./images/Pipeline_Worker_Tile.png)

   Make sure that your registered worker is in the list: 

   ![Pipeline Registered workers](./images/Pipeline_Worker_Registered_Pool.png)

4. Return to your toolchain's overview page.
